            <h3 style="color:green;">Why did I try to make a game for this assignment?</h3>
            <span>I don't know... Just wanted to over complicate things lol.</span>
            <span>I don't fully grasp what span is for. I'm thinking it will make sense later on and may be a useful tool later with more complex websites.</span>
            <!--here I wanted to try and make the links display from left to right with bullet points but it dosen't seem to work. My guess is that I cant make a block element into a inline element just by adding span-->
